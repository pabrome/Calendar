# Calendar
This is a simple, functional day planner. 

The table is colour coded so it's easy to follow. A grey block means the hour has already passed. A red slot denotes the current hour. A green slot is a future.

The user can type in events, to-do items, meetings, etc... into each time slot and click the button on the right to save that item into their local storage.
